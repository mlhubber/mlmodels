Movie Recommendation 
====================

The MovieLens data sets are popular data sets for building
recommendation models in research, education and development. The
dataset (ml-latest-small) used in this demonstration contains 100,004
5-star ratings across 9125 movies created by 671 users between 9
January 1995 and 16 October 2016. The dataset records the userId,
movieId, rating, timestamp, title, and genres. The goal is to build a
recommendation model to recommend new movies to users.

This pre-built model has used the R language to build a recommendation
model to represent the knowledge discovered using a so-called Smart
Adaptive Recommendations (SAR) algorithm. The knowledge representation
is easy to understand.

The **demo** applies the pre-built model to a demo data set with records
from 10 users and shows the recommendation results for 2 users.

The **print** will display a textual summary of the model and its build
parameters.
